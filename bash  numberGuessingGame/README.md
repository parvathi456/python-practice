Number Guessing Game using Python:

A simple command-line game where the computer selects a random number between 1 and 100, and the user tries to guess it. Helpful hints and attempt tracking included!

Key learnings:

- Always put the `attempts += 1` at the start of the loop so all guesses are counted.
- Make sure the congratulations message and `break` statement come right after the correct guess - ie. it should be placed first.
- Generate the random number after confirming the user wants to play (optional).
- Using while True: effectively to run a continuous game session.
